# Sports-Popularity-Forecast
This project is to measure the popularity of each league using the search data collected from Google Trends, which give real-time historical data on search words. With this project, it is also possible to compare and forecast how the sports league are trending with respect to each other using three models â€” trend plus seasonality regression, Holt-Winters Multiplicative (HWMM), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA). Businesses interested in advertising or investing with either league may leverage these forecasts for deciding which sports league provides the greater or long-term value.
